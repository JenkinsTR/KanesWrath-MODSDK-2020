One more 'accident' like that and the Council will have my neck - and your budget. You've lost almost two dozen workers in the last year alone and, as you are WELL aware, these aren't your garden-variety beaker-slingers, these are top-ranked Tib scientists and they're getting harder to replace! You have to understand, Jack, people just don't want to work for you, not with all that's happened already, no matter how many zeroes we add to their paychecks. \n \nI understand the potential you see in Liquid Tiberium, and I applaud your passion, but I'm beginning to side with those in the council who seriously doubt whether this line of inquiry will amount to anything other than billions of credits - and lives - down the drain. \n \nListen Jack, I'm at the end of my tether here. Get it together and start producing results or we're going to shut you down. \n \n- Eliot"

	"Good evening. I'm Darius Wong. \n \nReports are beginning to emerge of a devastating Tiberium explosion in Central Australia, one that may have long term environmental consequences for the Southern Hemisphere - and the world.  \n \nWe go now to Leanne Downing, reporting to us live from Hobart, Tasmania. \n \nLeanne... \n \n'Darius. \n \nIt all started as a green glow in the sky, visible from as far as Auckland, New Zealand. Now, as panicked citizens attempt to flee what appears to be the largest environmental catastrophe since the Tiber incident, the world is asking one question - who did this? And why? \n \nThere are widespread fears that this horrific event is a sign that the long dormant Brotherhood of Nod has returned. However, highly-placed sources within GDI have informed us that the catalyst for this explosion may have been an accident in a top-secret GDI Tiberium research laboratory in the Australian outback. \n \nNow, as millions are driven from their homes, as a continent is consumed by the deadly crystal, one can only ask - why did GDI let this happen? What are they REALLY doing to protect us?'"

To put it bluntly - things are bad, very, very bad. Last night, an unidentified entity broke though our defenses, shut down our power and triggered an explosive device within the Treasury itself.  \n \nThe level of damage inflicted is unknown, but initial estimates indicate that the losses might be in the billions. We have no leads, no suspects - although initial evidence gathering has lead us to believe that the culprits may be the 'Sons of Umagon', a militant Mutant separatist group - and we have no idea how we are going to explain this to the Council. \n \nWe need you, Mr. Boyle, and we need you now. \n \nYours, \n \nRamon"

Bynes, Director, Department of Covert R&D, Washington DC, USA \n \nJohan, \n \nFirstly, let me state that I have every level of respect for the excellence and professionalism of you and your staff. There is no finer research team operating in this country, if not the world. Now, with that said, I have some major concerns regarding your most recent enterprise. Simply put, the latest reports from your facility regarding the Tacitus' stability disturb me - and the Council - to no end.\n \nTo hear that the device is estimated as having a 15% chance of self-destruction, with the chance increasing with each test run, is just not acceptable. Look, I understand that you are operating in unknown territory here, but I need to be very clear about one thing - if you are doing anything that risks the stability of the Tacitus, anything at all, you must STOP, immediately. \n \nI'm sorry to speak so strongly, but we cannot risk losing the device. Too many people died to secure it, we have no idea how dangerous the Tacitus' destruction would be and, most importantly, there is no way it can be replaced. In short, to risk the device is to risk everything that we've worked to achieve. \n \nI'll be flying out to discuss this with you Monday. Until then, kid gloves. \n \nSincerely, \n \nTheo"

While the device has remained safe in GDIs fortified Cheyenne Mountain complex since its recapture from Nod two years ago, it is believed that Kane managed to extract an unknown amount of information beforehand. This data vanished with Nod at the end of the Second Tiberium War, leaving us with no concrete evidence as to what the so-called Prophet planned to use it for. \n \nGiven the lack of Nod activity over the last three years, one can only conclude that he failed. \n \nDespite Dr. Boudreaus breakthroughs in the early 2030s, progress continues to be slow for our own attempts to interface with the device. What information it holds, and what value said information had to Kane, continue to be matters of serious concern for this agency."

Cloistered away in the wastelands of central Asia, these scientists spent the ensuing decades pursuing that goal, the first results of which became visible with the Cyborg Infantry and Commando utilized by CABAL during the Second Tiberium War. \n \nThe Awakened are the end product of this research, deceased Nod soldiers mechanically re-animated and controlled via cyber-neurological implant devices linked to central 'control nodes' across the globe.

Alternating between two modes, one high-speed and stealthed, the other visible and static but capable of launching high-impact artillery from a massive distance, the Specter is a confounding opponent to face in battle. Able to enter occupied territory undetected, deploy, take out key structures and vanish before the enemy can hope to react, it is truly an insidious and dangerous opponent. This is even more the case when the unit is paired with the equally stealthy Nod Shadow Team, which has been equipped with targeting beacons, allowing the Specter to launch bombardment attacks from an even greater distance."

After using an improvised flamethrower to rout entrenched GDI forces, saving the rest of his regiment from certain death, Marcion was declared a hero of Nod and saw his very presence have an inspirational effect on the Nod Militants that surrounded him. \n \nThe Purifier was developed to recreate that experience, representing Marcion on the battlefield in the iconic form of a hulking, flame-toting humanoid, one equipped with a subliminal projection device that would enhance the morale and righteousness of the Black Hand troops surrounding it.  While by no means as advanced or flexible as its successor, the Purifier is an effective combat unit in its own right, especially when accompanied by infantry it can 'inspire.' \n \nIronically enough, upon its initial deployment, the Purifier was the subject of no small amount of controversy, with many Black Hand hardliners decrying the use of a 'soulless machine' within a religious army that otherwise stood opposed to such devices. Marcion, seeking to prevent further schism within the Black Hand, remedied the situation by requiring each machine be blessed by a Black Hand abbot before entering the battlefield."

	"For the third time this year, a separatist Nod settlement in the Central African region has been brutally attacked. While investigations are ongoing, initial reports identify the deceased as respected prophecy scholar Caleb Kovacs, his wife Ileana, daughter Alexa and an unidentified number of servants. \n \nWhile the mainstream media continues to dismiss these attacks as the work of Mutant fundamentalists, the Fist of the Prophet can exclusively reveal that there may be more sinister forces behind the attack - forces stemming from within the Brotherhood itself. Evidence gathered from the ruins (and, according to our sources, suppressed on the direct orders of Anton Slavik) has been made available to us. \n \nAnalysis of this evidence reveals the attackers not to be Mutants, but Cyborgs, under the direct control of the renegade AI CABAL. The Fist has raised concerns about CABAL's stability and the Brotherhood's general dependence on such soulless machinery in the past, but even as the evidence mounts, Slavik refuses to accept the truth, and now the Prophet's most devout followers are paying the price for his willful blindness."

	"Once the leader of the Brotherhood's religious wing, charged with proselytizing the prophecies of Kane, Marcion grew disillusioned with the Brotherhood and its leader as the Second Tiberium War drew to a close. Increasingly outspoken, few within the Inner Circle were surprised when Marcion was the first to break with Nod following their devastating series of losses, branding the deceased Prophet a charlatan and retreating to the Australian outback.\n \nMarcion was not quiet for long; his powerful oratorical skills and deeply ascetic lifestyle won him many devotees in what would come to be known as yellow zones. Within a year of his break with Nod, Marcion had organized his followers into a disciplined theocratic army - the 'new' Black Hand. Dedicated to spreading 'truth and purity of the Tiberium prophecy,' their popular support continues to grow amongst the increasingly splintered Nod survivors.\n \nRumors that GDI had a hand in Marcion's break with Kane remain unsubstantiated."

	"A cult within a cult, the origins of the Black Hand date back to soon after the founding of Nod itself. Initially established as a form of religious police and tasked with enforcing adherence to the teachings of Kane, in the ensuing years the Black Hand saw their purview expand significantly. By the time of the Second Tiberium War, the cult had become Kane's chosen wardens of all things religious, charged with the distributing and proselytizing of his prophecies while also maintaining spiritual discipline within the Brotherhood...by force if necessary. \n \nThe Black Hand maintains a parallel organization within the Brotherhood with political, religious and military wings. \n \nYet, for all of their power and influence, until recently the Black Hand had managed to maintain a surprisingly low profile, shrouding their rituals, beliefs and, to the world beyond Nod, their very existence in a veil of mystery and obfuscation. However, as the Second Tiberium War drew to a close, all this would change. With Kane's 'death', Anton Slavik, a respected military leader, rose to become leader of the Brotherhood of Nod - and revealed himself to be a Black Hand prelate, raised from childhood within the cult. Needless to say, Slavik's ascent drew significant attention to the Black Hand, attention that was not always welcomed. \n \nUnsurprisingly, many within the Black Hand chafed at the cult's new public profile, with internal dissent quickly escalating into a series of impassioned public confrontations between Slavik loyalists and those who claimed the Nod leader to be a traitor to the Black Hand's true purpose. From within the anti-Slavik ranks there soon rose a figure who could stand toe-to-toe with Slavik, an impassioned and popular preacher by the name of Brother Marcion. With leaders chosen and battle-lines drawn, what had started as a doctrinal disagreement had quickly escalated into a schism that threatened the very existence of Nod itself. \n \nDespite the Inner Circle's repeated attempts to heal the rift, the situation soon spun out of control, leaving Slavik dead at the hands of an assassin and Marcion and his followers retreating to self-imposed exile in the Australian outback. These cataclysmic events splintered the remainder of the Brotherhood into countless sub-factions, each claiming to follow the 'true' word of the Prophet, with, ironically, Marcion's new Black Hand serving as one of four surviving links to the Brotherhood's storied past. \n \nNow claiming himself to be the one true prophet, and, in turn, branding Kane a heretic and charlatan, Marcion sets forth to make his own mark upon the world."

	"With the end of the Second Tiberium War and the Brotherhood of Nod's subsequent implosion, GDI came to believe that the quasi-state and fanatical cult no longer represented a significant threat to Earth's population. Consequently, GDI shifted its strategic goals from defeating Nod to the reclamation of those parts of the planet previously consumed by Tiberium. The vast majority of GDI's research and development budget was repurposed to further that goal, bringing to a close the period of rapid technological development that had characterized GDI's military over the previous several decades. \n \nNeedless to say, there were several within the military who questioned this new directive - notably General Joshua 'Mitch' Mitchell, a decorated veteran of the Second Tiberium War renowned for his youth, aggressiveness and tactical innovation. Mitchell contended that while Nod may have been defeated, it would be foolish for GDI to assume that no successor would rise from the dispirited populace of an increasingly Tiberium-stricken earth. Therefore, he argued, funds allocated towards Tiberium control should instead be earmarked for the research and development of new combat technology, in anticipation of this next potential conflict. \n \nAfter a lengthy, volatile hearing, Mitchell emerged with a partial victory. While GDI refused to divert a significant part of its R&D budget to the General's cause, they did agree to fund a new experimental combat technology division under Mitchell. Dubbed the 'Steel Talons' by Mitchell's admirers - notably famed war hero Nick 'Havoc' Parker - this elite, unconventional combat battalion quickly rose to prominence in the splinter faction skirmishes that followed Nod's implosion, becoming known both for their ruthless efficiency on the battlefield and for the shroud of secrecy they maintained at all other times."

After surviving  over a year alone in the burnt-out remains of her parents' homestead, Alexa was discovered mute and near-starving by a patrolling group of Nod scavengers.\n\nIntelligent and pragmatic, she quickly took up with her rescuers as a rookie zone runner. Kovacs' devout religious beliefs and near-preternatural understanding of cybernetics and AI quickly garnered attention within the Brotherhood, leading to her enrollment in the Nod Academy.\n\nRising quickly through the ranks post-graduation, Kovacs developed a reputation for coldness, reserve and near-fanatical religious dogmatism that segregated her from her peers - and drew the attention of Kane himself. Despite her youth, Alexa was raised to the level of Abbess and enlisted to participate in one of the Nod leader's most secretive projects - working on the development of LEGION, a CABAL-derived experimental combat AI.

	"As the First Tiberium War drew to a close, pervasive and disturbing rumors began to emerge from the Tiberium wastelands of Central Asia and the Russian Steppes. Nomadic travelers and Nod separatist colonies alike have shared tales of Nod bunkers hidden deep beneath the earth - laboratories where cultish techno-fetishists perform horrific rituals upon the corpses of the Brotherhood's fallen - the goal? Nothing less than raising the dead. \n \nNeedless to say, Nod has continually denied all knowledge of any such acts, and even those within the Brotherhood believe these Necromantic tales to be little more than the mutterings of frightened outcasts. The truth, however, is far stranger. In the aftermath of his first defeat at the hands of GDI, Kane spent long days pondering how it was that Nod had been defeated. Ultimately, he formulated a unique hypothesis - the humanity of his soldiers had been their undoing. Thus, the Prophet concluded, to achieve victory he would require an army devoid of free will - of love, hate, fear and regret, of both conscience and consciousness, a legion that would willingly and unquestioningly obey his every command. \n \nTo that end, Kane initiated the development of an army of emotionless, endlessly malleable cybernetic warriors that would do his bidding without question. Knowing that such research would cause dissension within the ranks of his existing army, the Prophet sequestered this work in the hinterlands of Russia and China, where few would stumble across the project and even fewer would be believed if they shared such tales. \n \nThe path was long and arduous, and outside of a few promising developments - the most notable being the cyborg armies of CABAL - far from successful. Eventually, as the Second Tiberium War drew to a close, the Marked of Kane finally neared completion. However, it was too late to save Nod and the Marked of Kane were left to slumber deep beneath the Earth, awaiting their master's call..."

	"With a post-Nod GDI shifting its focus to the reduction and eventual elimination of Tiberium, it was natural for the council to establish a branch of the military tasked with the enforcement and execution of that goal - Zone Operations Command, or ZOCOM. Their peacetime mission was threefold; to improve GDI's military capabilities within areas of high Tiberium infestation, to establish 'beachheads' within such areas allowing reclamation to commence, and to protect existing reclamation operations from any attacks, be they terrorist or mutant in origin. \n \nCommand was given to the eminently qualified C. Elena Renteria, a decorated war hero and one of the first women to rise to the rank of General within GDI. Beyond her reputation as a smart, no-nonsense battlefield commander, Renteria's unique upbringing provided insight into the task at hand. The daughter of Mexican nationals, the General spent her childhood in the Tiberium wastelands of central Africa, while her parents, both GDI scientists, attempted to understand and contain the deadly crystal. After witnessing firsthand the devastating effect of Tiberium on the human population of those areas, Renteria dedicated the rest of her life to its elimination; first focusing on the systematic and ruthless dismantling of the Brotherhood of Nod, and then later through ZOCOM's Tiberium control and reclamation operations. \n \nFew would deny that Red Zone service is perhaps the most demanding of any GDI assignment. Most soldiers cannot endure significant Tiberium exposure for more than a few weeks at a time without risking serious physical and psychological damage. There are exceptions, however - men and women who find the experience of living and fighting in a near alien environment to be an energizing, engaging experience. These individuals quickly find themselves assigned to ZOCOM - and few, if any, would be happy anywhere else."

Believed to have been established in eons past as a first-strike native pacification force, the Cult has since cloaked its purpose in religious overtones. The members regard it as their divine right to cleanse planets of any life forms perceived as potentially dangerous, with that definition determined almost entirely within the cult itself. \n \nEven within the Cult of Reaper, the 17th sect are considered almost preternaturally violent, displaying acts of unparalleled cruelty such that few within the Scrin wish to even acknowledge their existence. Of particular distaste to their fellow Scrin is Reaper-17's penchant for excessive Tiberium infusion, far beyond that which its parent race requires to survive. This deranged form of self-mutilation, a form of religious zealotry, has left many of their members as grotesquely mutated as they are immensely powerful. Outcasts even within their own society, Reaper-17 continue to plow their own bloody furrow...one that will next lead them to the planet known as Earth."

It would take but a single act to spur the disenfranchised masses into open insurrection.\n\nAn act you must perform.\n\nTear down GDI's authoritarian edifices, the symbols of their autocracy. Seize the radio stations and flood the airwaves with the Prophet's message.\n\nIncite rebellion.\n\nRio will burn, and in the flames Kane's army shall be reborn."

	"Nod is resurgent, but remains weak in the face of GDI's vast technological superiority. The Brotherhood Archives were all but destroyed in the aftermath of the Second Tiberium War, leaving Kane without access to his centuries of research.\n\nParadoxically, our friends at GDI have provided a most convenient solution. An exact duplicate of our stealth databank, origin unknown, is under analysis at a covert GDI Research Facility on the Australian coast.\n\nReclaim what is ours."
End

MissionLoading:CM_1_3
	"The Brotherhood continues to grow and prosper, but the Prophet cannot risk revealing his existence lest he draw GDI's unwanted attention.\n\nA figurehead must be found to rule in his stead.\n\nKane, in his infinite wisdom, has decreed the renegade heretic Brother Marcion to be the most fitting candidate. There is but one problem with this initiative - the devout Marcion considers Kane to be a heretic himself.\n\nConvince the good Brother otherwise."
End

MissionLoading:CM_1_4
	"With Marcion returned to the fold, Nod approaches resurrection. All Kane requires now is a sign, an act, a message to the faithful that the Brotherhood has returned.\n\nIn central Australia, a GDI research team struggles to harness the raw, untamed power of liquid Tiberium. Should their experiments be destabilized, the results would be quite...catastrophic.\n\nSoon, all the world shall bear witness to Nod's violent rebirth."
End

MissionLoading:CM_2_1
	"While you slumbered, Nod has grown and evolved, assuming control of the planet's newly established yellow zones while remaining dormant in the eyes of our enemies.\n\nAll the while, GDI has grown complacent, lazy, their dependence on the global Ion Cannon network rendering them far weaker than the council could possibly imagine.\n\nNow is the time to act.\n\nWe must raid GDI's Johannesburg research facility, for there we shall find the plans for Ion Cannon network - and the means to its undoing."
End

MissionLoading:CM_2_2
	"The Prophet has the space station Philadelphia - and the Ion Cannon Network it controls - in his sights. In days Kane shall destroy it, eliminating the GDI council.\n\nThere is one council member, however, who must survive - Redmond Boyle, GDI's craven treasurer. As strange as it sounds, this incompetent politician is essential to Kane's plan. He must live, so he may become the GDI president...and fall right into the Prophet's trap.\n\nWe have dispatched an infiltration team to the GDI Treasury. Destroy it and force Boyle to remain earthbound."
End

MissionLoading:CM_2_3
	"Dr. Alphonse Giraud, GDI's leading Liquid Tiberium research scientist, has become an impediment. He must disappear before he can enlighten the fool Boyle, or Kane's plan will be endangered.\n\nGiraud's facilities are located in Blue Zone 8, in the same Chilean spaceport formerly used to staff and maintain the Philadelphia.\n\nThe Prophet requires Giraud alive - he believes the good doctor can be converted to our cause.\n\nDo not fail him."
End

MissionLoading:CM_2_4
	"Nod central command has received disturbing reports from the African Red Zone. ZOCOM, GDI's elite anti-Tiberium task force, have commenced reclamation efforts.\n\nWhile this is disturbing, even more unsettling is the news that ZOCOM deployed a new weapon in their war against the crystal  - the Mammoth Armed Reclamation Vehicle, or MARV.\n\nThis massive Mammoth/Harvester hybrid has already decimated several scout patrols, and we as of yet lack an appropriate counter. You must track down the MARV, locate the ZOCOM base where it is maintained and learn how it is built.\n\nOnly then can we construct an appropriate response."
End

MissionLoading:CM_2_5
	"Kilian Qatar has shown her true colors - the general is a heretic, plotting against Kane. As the general has wormed her way into the public's good graces, Abbess Alexa believes them unlikely to accept her heresy on faith alone.\n\nThey will require proof. Proof that you will provide.\n\nKane's forces are currently engaged in a desperate defense of Temple Prime. Infiltrate the battle in the guise of Kilian and commit an act of unforgivable betrayal.\n\nSoon, all the world will know."
End

MissionLoading:CM_2_6
	"The cities of the world's Yellow Zones are an essential source of the support, sanctuary and soldiers Nod requires in our struggle against GDI. Without them, the Brotherhood would be nothing but an empty shell.\n\nA mysterious alien force has appeared on the outskirts of the city of Kampala, Uganda. Using an insidious form of mind control, they have bent the populace to their will.\n\nKane cannot risk such instability during this critical time. Eliminate these creatures and take back our city."
End

MissionLoading:CM_2_7
	"Thanks to your unique provenance, the Tacitus has finally been located. The ancient device is currently in mainland China, secure in a ZOCOM convoy. It is almost within our grasp, but there are...complications.\n\nWord has reached us that the council is planning to evacuate the device by sea, and, as you are well aware, we are not equipped to tackle the GDI navy. You must capture the device before it reaches its destination - disrupt the convoy, capture the device and bring it to Kane.\n\nAscension draws near..."

In the eyes of the world, the Brotherhood has finally been annihilated.\n\nAll is not as it seems.\n\nFrom his underground bunker, Kane calls on you, LEGION, to awaken the Marked of Kane. It is with this cybernetic army that you shall claim the Tacitus.\n\nAscension draws near."
End

MissionLoading:CM_3_2
