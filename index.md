The unofficial Kane's Wrath Mod SDK is designed to combine and enhance all of the required, useful and not-so useful tools, assets, examples and documentation for the modification of Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath.

This SDK is built on the latest, stable version of WrathEd (1.10).
It includes all updates and fixes made by other respected members of the community.

Included are example Art assets, including working Sample code for adding new units, replacing or adding music and audio, changing main menu graphics, and much more!

This serves as a repository for archival purposes, as some essential tools are getting harder to track down as the years go by.

A lot of SDK files from CnC3: Tiberium Wars are included for both use and reference (as a great deal of Kane's Wrath is built upon these files).

Development is underway for a better BuildMod.bat (at this time referred to as BuildMod_NEW.bat) which aims to resolve some more advanced problems, and also to maintain a more appropriate way of compiling mods.

Documentation is also a big focus here, and many different "How to mod xxxx" threads from various forums have been compiled and checked for quality, and incorporated into this SDK.

Better documentation that explains all the files and their connections is currently being worked on.
