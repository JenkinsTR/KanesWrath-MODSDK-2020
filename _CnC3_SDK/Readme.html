<H4 align="left"><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">3DS Max plugin</FONT></H4>
<P align="left"><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">There are 2 sets of 3DS Max plugins 
included in this package. One requires that you have 3DS Max 9 and the other, 3DS Max 7 with 
		service pack 1 or 3DS Max 8 installed.</FONT></P>
<P align="left"><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">To install, copy the contents of "3dsmax7_plugin" 
found in your MOD SDK folder into their respective folders in the "3dsmax7" install directory. 
Similarly, copy the contents of &quot;3dsmax9_plugin&quot; into the respective folders for 
3dsmax9.</FONT></P>
<P align="left"><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">This will copy the actual plugin, several 
		useful MaxScripts and shaders that can be used in Max to configure materials. 
		See the 3DSMax section in the </FONT><A href="Documentation/Index.htm"><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">
			documentation</FONT></A><FONT face="Trebuchet MS"> for more info.</FONT></P>
<H4 align="left"><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">W3XViewer</FONT></H4>
<P align="left"><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">The W3XViewer can be launched from anywhere, 
		and does not need to be copied. If you have all your art files (W3X files and 
		textures) in one directory W3XView can find them all together; however, 
the game 
		file structure layout is different:</FONT></P>
<UL>
	<LI>
		<DIV align="left"><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">W3X files, by default, need 
			to be in a directory 
				"Art\XX\" where XX is the first two letters of the file name. That 
				directory needs to be below your installed MOD SDK directory. So a full path might be 
				"C:\MOD SDK\Art\GB\GB_Conyard01.w3x&quot;</FONT></DIV>
	<LI>
		<DIV align="left"><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">Further Details on how art 
			works can be found in the section detailing how the Sample MOD was 
			created in the <A href="Documentation/Index.htm">documentation</A>.</FONT></DIV>
	</LI>
</UL>
<P align="left"><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">Typically our artists create W3X files and 
		textures for one unit or&nbsp;structure in a single directory, and then copy 
		over the final files into the W3X and texture directories that the game needs.</FONT></P>
<h4 align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS">BuildMOD.bat</font></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: black">The 
MOD SDK installer creates a .bat file in the root of your install directory.&nbsp; To 
build your MOD simply run this from a command prompt and pass it one parameter 
which is the name of your MOD.&nbsp; You can test this on the Sample MOD by running BuildMOD.bat SampleMOD from the command line.&nbsp; This will create and generate a 
.big file for you.&nbsp; Once you’ve successfully built your MOD, the big file for 
your MOD will be located in the BuiltMODs\MODs folder.&nbsp; In the case of the 
Sample MOD this will be samplemod.big.&nbsp; The .bat file will also automatically 
copy this file to the My Documents\Command &amp; Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars\mods\&lt;mod 
name&gt; folder.&nbsp; This is where your completed MODs should be placed to be run in 
the game.&nbsp; The only step left to getting your MOD to appear in the game is the 
creation of a Skudef file</span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS"> and 
will be covered in the section labeled &quot;Completing the MOD&quot; under <b>Sample MOD</b> in the </span><FONT face="Trebuchet MS"><A href="Documentation/Index.htm">documentation</A>.</FONT></p>
