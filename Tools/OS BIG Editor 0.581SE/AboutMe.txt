OS BIG Editor is a program made to view BIG files and it will be able to create and edit them as well.

This program was created and coded by Carlos "Banshee" Muniz and the RefPack decompression was coded by Johnathan Wilson (jonwil).

The following people contributed to add features for this program:

-> Danny van Loon (Drag .BIG files and Drop in the program. He also found the Drag and Drop component used in the program. He has also contributed with the TreeView interface and custom graphics)
-> Igi (Reorganized the code, added ini support for options and language)
-> Zlatko Minev (coded the TGA Viewer - v0.5)
-> Stuart "Stucuk" Carey (There are several things from Voxel Section Editor III and SHP Builder that he coded and were used in this program - all versions).
-> RefPack compression code by KUDr
-> CRC code was adapted from XCC Utilities, by Olaf van der Spek.
-> Prabab for a quick bug fix and an unnoficial polish version of the program.
-> TARGA library by Davie Reed
-> TPNGImage Library, by Gustavo Huffenbacher
-> TSHyper for graphical contributions
-> Siberian GRemlim for the russian language.
-> Alexander Ionov for the AES decryption
