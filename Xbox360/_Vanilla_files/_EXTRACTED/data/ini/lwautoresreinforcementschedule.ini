; When the reinforcement armies show up for the defender
AutoResolveReinforcementSchedule Defender
	1 = 0 ; Primary army is available at round zero. VERY IMPORTANT: do not change this, or 
	      ; battles will end immediately because there are no armies available at the start of battle!
	2 = 2 ; Second army available at the beginning of round 2
	3 = 3 ; Third army available at the beginning of round 3
	4 = 4 ; Fourth army available at the beginning of round 4
	; You can add more armies explicitly, but I think the pattern is pretty obvious, so let's
	; just go to the big finish:
	EachRemaining = +1 ; For each army after the last listed, wait 1 additional round before bringing on another
End
