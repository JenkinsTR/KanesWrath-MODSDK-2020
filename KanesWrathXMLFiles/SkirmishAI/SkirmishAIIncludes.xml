		SkirmishAIIncludes.xml is the central include for SkirmishAI setup data.
		It will be loaded first at game startup and can configure subsystem data.
		Do not include game objects here, as art assets cannot be loaded before the subsystems are fully started.
		They should be included in the static.xml or the map.xml.
