		<h3>Sage Engine</font></h3>
		<p>Command &amp; Conquer 3&nbsp;was created 
		using Electronic Art’s (EA) Sage Engine.&nbsp;It has been used on Command &amp; 
		Conquer: Generals, Command &amp; Conquer Generals: Zero Hour, and The Lord 
		of the Rings: The Battle for Middle Earth I &amp; II &amp; The Rise of the 
		Witch-king.</p>
		<p>The Sage Engine utilizes 3DSMax as 
		its main application for creating art.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;4 main tools that are 
		used in 3DSMax: .W3X Exporter, w3d Skin modifier, w3d utilities and w3d 
		materials. These are generally referred to as the W3D tools.</p>
		<p>The W3X viewer allows the user to 
		view the W3X files exported from max before bringing them in-game.</p>
		<p>The Sage Engine also uses World 
		Builder, which is a proprietary application for the creation of 
		single-player and multiplayer maps for the game.  An updated version of Worldbuilder
		is required for creating maps which depend on content in a Command &amp; Conquer 3 mod, and 
		can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.commandandconquer.com/community/worldbuilder/default.aspx" target="_blank">Command and Conquer.com</a></p>
			<p>
		MODs in the Sage Engine for Command &amp; Conquer 3 have several required applications.
