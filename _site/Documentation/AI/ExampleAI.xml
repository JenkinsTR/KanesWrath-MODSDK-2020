  AIPersonalityDefinition declares several important attributes of your AI.
		id - the name that will appear in the WorldBuilder Player List drop-down menu
		PersonalityType - this value must match the id field
		PersonalityUIName - references an entry in the cnc3.str file to provide the Skirmish Select Menu string
		SkirmishPersonality - set this to "false" to have the AI appear in WorldBuilder
		SecondsTillTargetsCanExpire - this is the amount of time before the AI will choose another candidate for an TacticalAITarget.
			It is used to make sure the AI does not continue to select old targets.
		ChanceForTargetToExpire - the chance the target will expire after the designated amount of time from SecondsTillTargetsCanExpire
		MaxBuildingsToBeDefensiveTarget_Small - this is unused
		MaxBuildingsToBeDefensiveTarget_Med - this is unused
		ChanceForUnitsToUpgrade - this is unused
		ChanceToUseAllUnitsForDefenseTarget_Small - this is unused
		ChanceToUseAllUnitsForDefenseTarget_Med - this is unused
		ChanceToUseAllUnitsForDefenseTarget_Large - this is unused
		DesiredExcessPowerBuffer - determines how much extra power the AI attempts to maintain
		BaseCompactness - a value between 0 and 1 that determines how compact an AI builds its base.  Only values between 0.5 and 1 will actually work.
			A value of 1 is the furthest out on the build radius circle; a lower value is closer in from the build radius circle.
		DefaultThreatFindRadius - deprecated or unused value
		UnitBuilderCostEffectivenessWeight - determines how heavily the AI relies on cost effectiveness (power / cost) in deciding what unit to build.  
			Lowering this will make the AI pick the best unit without concern for cost.
		UnitBuilderMoneyVersusTimePreference - determines if the AI wants to build units with low build times relative to cost or high build times relative to cost.  
			Since all units in C&C3 were normalized to have build time and costs proportional this is effectively unused.
		UnitBuilderOverallOffensivePreference - weighs a unit's damage more heavily than its health and armor when the AI decides what unit to build.
		UnitBuilderOverallDefensivePreference - weighs a unit's health and armor more heavily than its damage when the AI decides what unit to build.
		Expansion_TiberiumSearchRadius - the radius around a player’s base to consider a Tiberium field as accessible from that base  
			The AI only picks Tiberium fields more than this distance away from any base to expand to.
		Expansion_MaxTiberiumRemaining - the amount of tiberium around all the AI's bases must drop below this value before it tries to expand.
		ReactiveDefenseRadius - determines how far out an AI will defend its base using the ReactiveDefense tactic (units are WorldBuilder feet)
		RepairBuildingsAtDifficulty - determines at what difficulties the AI will repair their buildings. 
			EASY MEDIUM HARD and BRUTAL are the legal values for all difficulty fields.
		EmergencyManagerHandleNoPowerAtDifficulty - determines at what difficulties the AI emergency manager will manage being low-power
			None of the Emergency Managers work for a SkirmishAI loaded through WorldBuilder.
		EmergencyManagerHandleNoIncomeAtDifficulty - determines at what difficulties the AI emergency manager will manage having no income
		EmergencyManagerHandleNoConyardAtDifficulty - determines at what difficulties the AI emergecny manager will manage having no conyard
		StructureSaveChanceEasy - determines percentage chance that the AI will sell a building before an engineer captures it on Easy
		StructureSaveChanceMedium - determines percentage chance that the AI will sell a building before an engineer captures it on Medium
	    StructureSaveChanceHard - determines percentage chance that the AI will sell a building before an engineer captures it on Hard

    The UnitBuilderUnitChoiceStrategy defines which units the AI will build by analyzing the opponents units.
		Shape - the Unit Builder analyzes every units' effectiveness vs. the opponents army and looks at a graph of the effectiveness.
				In the case below, on Easy, the UnitBuilder is looking at the worst counters the opponents units and picking them.
				In brutal, it is looking for the best counters for the opponents units and picking those.
		StandardDeviation - determines the range of units an AI will pick based on the shape defined.
							For example, if an AI is looking for units with a shape of "Middle" with a StandardDeviation of 2, it will
							pick from units that are the most middle-of-the-road counter to the player and units that are two positions worse
							and two positions better (for a total of 5 units).  
		Difficulty - determines on what difficulty the UnitBuilderUnitChoiceStrategy functions.  The possible choices are Easy, Medium
					 Hard and Brutal.

	UnitBuilderUnitChoiceStrategyAdaptive is an alternative to the UnitBuilderUnitChoiceStrategy.  The adaptive version analyzes how effective 
	the AI's choices have been and attempts to modify future unit choices based on this analysis.  You should not use an Adaptive unit builder 
	in the same difficulty that you are using an non-Adaptive strategy. 
	
	The Adaptive unit builder uses "Effectiveness" and "Efficiency" in its evaluation (whereas the normal unit builder above uses only
	effectiveness).  Effectiveness is the value that predicts how the two armies are stacked up.  Efficiency is a measure of how much 
	stuff the AI has managed to kill (based on unit costs) and how much of its own units have been killed in the process (also based 
	on unit costs).

		MinDelay - the minimum amount of time before the AI decides to build a different unit from a production structure

		MaxEfficiency - determines when the max delay is used; if the value is 1.0, then the AI will evaluate a new unit to build

	Unit Overrides are another way to control how the AI builds.  If your unit overrides for a particular queue (warfactory, barracks, or hangar)
	adds up to 100% then the AI will not use any of the Unit Builder standard or adaptive choices that you have setup.  Overrides are not at all
	reactive to the player's unit choices; they force the unit builder to produce particular units regardless of what the player has built.  
		UnitName - picks the unit to override
		Percentage - determines the override percentage chance.  If the percentage does not add up to 100% for a queue, the Unit Builder strategies defined 
			above will be used for those remaining percentage points.  For example if you have a Buzzer override of 25% and no other infantry overrides, the AI 
			will build Buzzers 25% of the time and use the Unit Builder strategy to determine what unit to build the other 75% of the time.  An override 
			percantage of 0% just means that there is no override.  A value of -1% will completey block a unit from being built.
	
	As with specific unit caps, you may override units of a faction different from that specified in the <Side> field to account for your AI
	capturing enemy production structures.
