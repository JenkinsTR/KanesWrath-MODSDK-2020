	<h3>Art Organization</h3>
<h4>Directory Structure</h4>
<p>The directory structure for Art assets is somewhat different than normal assets.  They use a single shared art location 
	(although you could change the BinaryAssetBuilder configuration, but that is beyond the scope of this document)
	and organize everything using subfolders to prevent too many files from being in a given directory.  Each art asset, whether it is a mesh or texture,
	is placed in a subfolder of the Art directory which is named using the first two letters of the name.  If you create a W3X file called Box.w3x, you would
	create a subfolder in the Art folder named Bo and then place the W3X file there.  For the sample mod, the directory structure is shown below:
</p>

<p>As you can see there, are directories EU, HC, Terrain, Images, and W3.  The Terrain and W3 folders should not concern you, although you can look through them
	if you are interested.  The Terrain folder is there for building maps, which is covered in the <a href="custommaps.htm">Custom Maps</a> section.  The W3 folder
	is for the W3X viewer and these files should not be changed or deleted.
</p>
<p>The Images folder is slightly different.  It is used for packed images, which are used for unit cameos.  In the Images folder you will find the texture and
	XML File used to create the command buttons used in the Sample mod.  When creating your mod, you will create a similar set of files and include them in your Mod.XML,
	if you plan to create new command buttons.
</p>
<h4>Naming Convention</h4>
<p>While not strictly required, it is recommended that you use a naming convention when creating and exporting your Art assets.  Note that due to limitations of the W3X
	format, <span class="important">your mesh file names can be no longer than 15 characters</span>.  As such, it is important to choose a naming convention that does not 
	require long file names.
	For C&amp;C 3, the naming conventions are explained in the image below:
