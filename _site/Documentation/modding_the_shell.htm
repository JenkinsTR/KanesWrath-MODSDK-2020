	<h3>Modding the Shell and In-Game UI</h3>
<h4>Basic Explanation</h4>
<p>MODding the shell is a little tricky.&nbsp; You need 
to know the name of the screen you are MODding so you can replace it properly.&nbsp; 
The Sample MOD has an example of updating the Main Menu.
</p>
<h4>Modding the Main Menu</h4>
<p>
	In the MOD SDK we have provided a default Main Menu 
screen located in the Default UI Screens\MainMenu folder.&nbsp; This contains all the 
files you will need to update the Main Menu screen.&nbsp; The Sample MOD simply 
updates the art files to reskin the MainMenu.
</p>
<h5>Data Structure</h5>
<p>
In your 
MODs data folder you will need a folder 
named AptUI.&nbsp; In this folder you can copy over the MainMenu files from the 
Default UI Screens folder.&nbsp; There should be a sub folder named MainMenu with all 
the Menu files in it.&nbsp; In the AptUI folder you will need an XML file that 
includes the MainMenu.xml.&nbsp; This is a bit redundant, but is necessary to get the 
proper directory structure in the big file that will be generated when you build 
your MOD.
</p>
<p class="code">
	&lt;Include type=&quot;all&quot; 
source=&quot;DATA:SampleMod/Data/AptUI/MainMenu/MainMenu.xml&quot; /&gt;
</p>
<p>You will also need to include your MainMenu.xml in your Mod.xml file.  The Include entry should look like this:</p>
<p class="code">
	&lt;Include type=&quot;reference&quot; 
source=&quot;DATA:SampleMod/Data/AptUI/MainMenu.xml&quot; /&gt;
</p>	
<p>
	This xml file will then include 
the MainMenu.xml that is located in the MainMenu folder on the disk.&nbsp; The 
directory structure for this is very important any errors in structure will 
cause the MOD to not function.&nbsp; You can now just replace whatever textures you 
wish as long as they have the same name as the file you are replacing.
