<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Building 
Your MOD:</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">The MOD SDK 
installer creates a .bat file in the root of your install directory.&nbsp; To build 
your MOD simply run this from a command prompt and pass it one parameter which 
is the name of your MOD.&nbsp; You can test this on the Sample MOD by running BuildMOD.bat 
SampleMOD from the command line:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Installation Folder:\&gt; BuildMOD.bat SampleMOD</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">&nbsp; 
<br>
<br>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red; font-weight: bold;">Windows Vista Only:&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial">The Buildmod.bat file must be run from an elevated (one with Administrator privileges) command prompt, which can be done by using Run as Administrator when starting cmd.</span></p>
This will create and generate a 
.big file for you.&nbsp; Once you’ve successfully built your MOD the big file for 
your MOD will be located in the BuiltMods\MODs folder.&nbsp; In the case of the 
Sample MOD this will be sampleMOD.big.&nbsp; The .bat file will also automatically 
copy this file to the My Documents\Command &amp; Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars\mods\&lt;mod 
name&gt; folder.&nbsp; This is where your completed MODs should be placed to be run in 
the game.&nbsp; The only step left to getting your MOD to appear in the game is the 
creation of a Skudef file which is covered in the next section of this document.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">

<span style="text-decoration: none">Building a Custom Map:</span></font></span></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
<font color="#000000">
<span style="text-decoration: none">If you have created a map that uses assets from your new 
MOD you will need to 
build this map before you build the MOD so that it is properly packed into your 
new big file.&nbsp; We have supplied a batch file to do this for you.&nbsp; Simply run the BuildMap.bat from the root of the 
MOD SDK install directory passing it two 
parameters, the name of your MOD and the name of your map.&nbsp; For example:</span></font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
<font color="#000000"><span style="text-decoration: none">BuildMap.bat SampleMOD 
SampleMap</span></font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red; font-weight: bold;">Windows Vista Only:&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial">The Buildmap.bat file must be run from an elevated (one with Administrator privileges) command prompt, which can be done by using Run as Administrator when starting cmd.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
<font color="#000000">
<span style="text-decoration: none">This file will copy your map file from the default save location to your 
MODs 
folder than process it with the Binary Asset Builder which will place the 
compiled files into your BuiltMODs directory.&nbsp; After doing this step you can 
build your MOD using BuildMOD.bat as indicated in the section above.</span></font></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Creating 
a SkuDef File:</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">The creation 
of the SkuDef file is the final step in getting your MOD to appear in the game.&nbsp; 
The name of the SkuDef file is very important.&nbsp; It should follow this format:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">&lt;modname&gt;_&lt;modversion&gt;.SkuDef</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">The 
SampleMOD SkuDef is named: SampleMOD_1.0.SkuDef.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">The SkuDef 
is just a text file that tells the game about your big file.&nbsp; Here is what 
the Sample MOD SkuDef file looks like on the inside:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Consolas; color: black">mod-game 1.7<br>
add-big samplemod.big</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">The first 
line tells the game what version of the game this MOD runs with.&nbsp; The second 
line just tells the game about your big file.&nbsp; The SkuDef file should be located 
in the same directory as your .big file in the My Documents folder listed in the 
previous section.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FF0000; font-family: Arial">Please note 
that the maximum length your mod name can be is 15 characters.</span></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Launching 
Your MOD in Game:</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Launch the 
Command &amp; Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars™ Control Center from the Start Menu, then 
click on the Game Launcher button.&nbsp; You will now be presented with a screen with 
two tabs Replays and MODs.&nbsp; Select the MODs folder if it has not already been 
selected.&nbsp; Find your MOD in the list, and click on the launch button.&nbsp; That’s 
it!&nbsp; You should now be checking out your MOD in-game.</span></p>
