<p>To create a custom shader, have a look at the ShaderWritingExample.fx file in 
the 3dsmax shader directory of the MOD SDK. A custom shader needs to exist in 
multiple locations to work with the various programs involved:</p>
<ul>
	<li>3DSMax first looks at the absolute path to a shader that might be stored 
	in a .max file. After that it searches for shader files according to its 
	External Files preference. It is suggested to have the maps/fx/cnc3 
	directory in this search path.</li>
	<li>W3XView has a subdirectory called “Shaders”, where it searches for 
	shaders. Put a copy of custom shaders in there</li>
	<li>For the game, place any shaders you create in the MOD SDK\Shaders 
	directory. The BuildMod.bat file will automatically copy this to the correct 
	location to be built and compressed into the mod big file created by the 
	build process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The shaders that shipped with CnC3 are already in big files. The MOD 
SDK provides versions of these that are compiled for 3DSMax in the maps/fx/cnc3 
directory and versions compiled for W3XView in its directory. Do not copy the 
files from one into the other, or use these shaders in the game/your MOD’s big 
file, as they have slight differences (to enable UI and previewing) compared to 
the shaders the game uses.</p>
