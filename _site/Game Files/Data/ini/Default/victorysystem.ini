; VictorySystem.ini
; This file controls the behavior of the Victory System for RTS.
; Overview:
; The victory system is designed to do the following:
;	a. Detect when a player wins a large battle. Multiple battles can happen on a single map.
;	b. Give a bonus to the units belonging to the winning player that were involved in the battle 
; How the victory system does this is by dividing the map up into cells. Each cell keeps track of the number
; of 'deaths' and 'kills' for each player that happen in that cell. The system also keeps track of the total
; number of 'kills' and 'deaths' for the entire map. When a threshold for the entire map (formula explained 
; further down) is reached then the cells are scaned to see if any cells qualify for Victory Status. For each
; cell that Qualifies for Victory status all of the units within a radius of that cell are given a 'Victory' bonus.
; 
;
; There are 2 types of INI blocks
; 1.	VictorySystemData : Controls variables that deal with common aspects of the victory system.
; 2.	FactionVictoryData : Controls how a faction determines a victory, this facilitates factions being able
;		to have unique methods of determining what a 'victory' is. E.G. Evil factions may place less value
;		on losing its own units than Good factions. 
;	SEE Comments in the INI blocks for a detailed explantation of hot the values are used.

VictorySystemData default
	CellSize			= 450		; This value controls the resolution of the Cells in the Victory system. Each cell is a 
									; square of this width/height. The number of cells in a map is the determined by the 
									; extents of the map and this value. So if our cell size was 450, a map that is 3150 units 
									; wide and 2250 units high would have ((3150 / 450) = 7 * (2250 / 450) = 5) or 35 cells.
									; IMPORTANT: Do not make this value to small, as it could quickly eat up a lot of memory as 
									; well as degrade performance. 
									
; The following variables control frame to frame erosion of the stats store in each cell. The frame to frame erosion is done so 
; that over time the stats fade down. This allows the system to discriminate an intense battle from a lot of small battles over a long
; period of time.
	ScalePerLogicFrame = 1.0		;  Each stat stored in a cell is scaled by this amount every logic frame. It should be greater than
									; 0 and less than or equal to 1.0. With the practical range being 0.7 - 0.999. The smaller the number
									; the 'faster' the system 'forgets'. Values above 1.0 are treated as 1.0
									
	SubtractPerLogicFrame = 0.0		; Each logic frame this value is subtracted from the stats in each cell. This value is here to 
									; allow greater control over how the system 'Erodes' the stats in a cell. The value must be positive
									; and should not be greater than 2 or 3. For reference a single uint is worth 1.0 stat points from
									; the perspective of the Victory system. So if SubtractPerLogicFrame was set 1.0, 1 'death' and one
									; 'Kill' would be 'forgotten' per logic frame. 
	
	CellBonusRadius = 1.0			; This value controls the range from the center of a cell in which units are give a victory bonus.
									; This actual range is a function of CellBonusRadius and CellSize, such that a value of 1.0 would
									; be a circle that completely contains 1 cell where the edge of the circle intersects the corners of
									; the cell. This value should not be below 1.0 to ensure that all the units that contributed to a 
									; 'victor' are rewarded. Also making the value to large should be avoided. The formula for 
									; the radius is; radius = (sqrt(2) * ((CellSize / 2) * CellBonusRadius).
									; NOTE: IF WE FIND PROBLEMS WITH UNITS GETTING MORE THAN 1 VICTORY BONUS AT A TIME
									; CHECK THIS VALUE FOR BEING TO LARGE.

; The following INI Blocks control how a faction decides when a 'Victory' has happened. Each faction has the following values
;	AllyDeathScaleFactor
;	EnemyKillScaleFactor
;	VictoryThreshold
;	MajorUnitValue
;	MapToCellVictoryRatio
;
; Determining a victory for a given player is done as follows.
; 
; if (NumberOfKillsOnMap * EnemyKillScaleFactor) - (NumberOfDeaths * AllyDeathScaleFactor) > VictoryThreshold
;	then if (NumberOfKillsInCell * EnemyKillScaleFactor) - (NumberOfDeaths * AllyDeathScaleFactor) > (VictoryThreshold * MapToCellVictoryRatio)
;		then give bonus to units in that cell.
