<!--
	* KindOfExemptFromAttraction - List the kind of types that we don't want the
	cursor "magnetically" attracted to.
	
	* ObjectAttractivityForce - The strength of the attraction between the cursor
	and the closest object to the cursor
	
	* MinAttractDistance - The distance in screen pixels where we start feeling
	the force of attraction.
	
	* MaxAttractiveForce - A value between 0.0 and 1.0 that specifies how much
	of the force we can use. ex. 1.0 means that we use the full force of attraction.
	This might fully override the users cursor because that force is also between 0.0 and 1.0
