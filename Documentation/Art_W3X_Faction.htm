	<h3>Faction Buildings</h3>
<p>
There are 5 states for a faction building:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Build Up</li>
<li>Pristine</li> 
<li>Damaged</li>
<li>Really Damaged</li>
<li>Rubble Collapsing</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also a few 
extra objects for some of the factions buildings (these are explained in detail 
below)</p>
<ol>
<li>Upgrade Pieces</li>
<li>(3) types of Windows (night, fire, glow). these are used very rarely.</li>
<li>Gags (characters with animations that interact with the buildings)</li>
</ol>
<h4>General 
					Rules When Creating Buildings&nbsp;</h4>
		<ol>
		<li>Use Alpha Test or Add, Do NOT use Alpha Blend
		<ol>
		<li>If a transparent texture is being applied to a 2 sided quad then check the 
				“Static Sorting Level” in the Material Surface Type rollout in the W3D 
				Material.
		</li>
		</ol>
		<li>Keep # of meshes as low as possible.
		<ol>
			<li>The build up state should have 5 meshes</li>
			<li>The Prisine state should have 1 mesh ( not including characters or windows )</li>
			<li>The D1 damage state should have 1 mesh ( not including the fire )</li>
			<li>The D2 damage state should have 5 meshes ( not including the fire )</li>
		</ol>
		<li>Planes should be 2 triangles</li>
		<li>Keep the vert counts as low as possible</li>
		<li>Try to Keep # of textures to &lt;= 2</li>
		<li>Minimize the # of bones, drop bones in medium and low models</li>
		<li>Minimize overdraw. Geometry that’s never seen should be eliminated. 
				However, Be careful not to delete geometry that may bee seen if the user rotates the 
				camera.</li>
		</ol>
		
				<h4>Faction Structure Budget</h4>
		<p>Verts 2000 / 1250 / 750 &nbsp;(High / Medium / Low&nbsp; LOD's)</P>
		<p>Texture size 2x512</P>
		<p>Max # meshes 2</P>
		<h4>Build Up Animation</h4>
		<p>For the build up animation the building will need to be separated into 
				pieces that are individually animated.&nbsp; Then a 1000 frame long animation of the 
				pieces coming&nbsp;up out of the ground will need to be created.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
				building should be cut into about 10 different&nbsp;pieces, each animated so 
				that the animation only lasts for about 20% of the whole 1000 frames.&nbsp; 
				Then the animation for the pieces should be staggered to take place over the 
				whole 1000 frame.</P>
		<p>
		The geometry&nbsp;should be exported as &lt;building name&gt;_A.w3x 
		</P>
		<p>
			The skeleton should be exported as &lt;building name&gt;_ASKL.w3x 
		</P>
			<p>
			The animation should be exported as &lt;building name&gt;_ABLD.w3x 
			</P>
		
			<p>
		<h4>Pristine</h4>
		<p>
				The pristine version of the building.
		<p>
				This should be exported as &lt;building name&gt;.w3x
		</p>
		<h4>Damaged</h4>
		<p>
				The damaged state is the pristine version of the building with the 
				damaged texture on it.
		<p>
				This should be exported as &lt;building name&gt;_D1.w3x
		</P>
		<h4>Really Damaged</h4>
		<p>
				The really damaged state is made up of 5 pieces: The main building, the 
				front, left, back, right.
		</p>
				
		<p>
				The 4 a,b,c,d pieces need to have their pivot points placed in the 
				center of each piece, while the main building needs to have it’s pivot point 
				placed at the origin.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; Note the 
				pivot points in the picture below.
				</P>
		<IMG src="images/Faction_Building_damage.jpg"><br />
		<p>This should be exported as &lt;building name&gt;_D2.w3x</p>
		<h4>Rubble Collapsing </h4>
		<p>This state is a crumbling animation of the left over main building 
		from the Really Damaged state. Simply subdivide the main building into 
		smaller pieces, closing off open sides, ensuring each piece has it's own 
		pivot point, and then animate the pieces.
		</P>
		<p>
		This should be exported as &lt;building name&gt;_D3.w3x
		</P>
		<h4>Upgrade Pieces</h4>
				
		<p>
Faction Buildings will have extra objects that start out hidden and are faded on 
as the building upgrades are purchased in the game, these pieces are called 
"Upgrade Pieces". They should be separate geometry and have very specific 
names: V1, V2, V3.
</p>

<h4>Windows</h4>
<p>
There 
are 3 different types of windows that a Faction building can have: Night time, 
Fire, and Glowing. The windows are extra geometry that overlay the normal 
windows of the building. This extra 
geometry will allow for some rendering effects to be added to the 
buildings.
</P>
<IMG src="images/Faction_Building_Windows.jpg" width="60%" height="70%"> <br />
<p>
The names for the windows follow this convention: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>WINDOW_G01 = Glow Window for a night time glow effect. </li>
<li>WINDOW_N01 = Night time window . </li>
<li>WINDOW_F01 = Fire Window for damaged states. </li>
<p>
You should use a Default W3D shader and the blend mode needs to be Additive. By using Additive 
the black pixels of the texture will be transparent and the lighter/whiter 
pixels in the texture will brighten the geometry behind it. 
</p>

<h4>Gags</h4>
<p>
Gags are&nbsp;characters with animations that interact with the buildings. These 
are only in&nbsp;Pristine version of the High LOD version of the 
building.</p>
