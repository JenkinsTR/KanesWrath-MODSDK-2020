<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Data Structure</font></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">When creating a MOD it is recommended you 
follow the data structure laid out in this section of the document, the 
structure can be changed but for the sake of this document we are going to 
assume you follow these guidelines.</span></p>
<span style="font-family: Arial">In the install directory there is a MODs 
folder.&nbsp; It is recommended you create a folder directly under this folder that 
corresponds with the name of whatever MOD you are creating, then in that folder 
create a data folder.&nbsp; You can see an example of this in the SampleMOD folder.&nbsp; 
This is important so the structure of your built MOD is correct and able to be 
read properly by the game after you have built the MOD.&nbsp; After this is done the 
directories created under data are up to the user wants to organize your data.</span><p><b><span style="font-family: Arial">Required Files:</span></b></p>
<span style="font-family: Arial">There is only one required file for MOD 
building and that is MOD.xml.&nbsp; This file is the file that should include 
any other files you are adding/editing for your MOD.&nbsp; This is the file that 
the batch file will try to build and directly corresponds to the name of the 
manifest file that will be created by the build process.&nbsp; This manifest is 
also hard coded in the game code so renaming it will cause your MOD not to work.</span><p>
<span style="font-family: Arial">The only other file that is hard coded as such 
is the MOD.str file.&nbsp; This file is optional and only needed if you are trying to 
add or modify text in the game.</span></p>
<b><span style="font-family: Arial">MOD.XML:</span></b><p>
<span style="font-family: Arial">This file is the main file that will be 
compiled by the BinaryAssetBuilderApplication. This file should include all 
files that you are MODding/editing.&nbsp; If it is not included in this file it will 
not be built.&nbsp; There are two files that should always be included as a reference 
when creating a MOD.&nbsp; These are static.xml and global.xml to represent the two 
main data streams the game loads, here is an example from the Sample MOD:</span></p>
<font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Consolas; color: black">&lt;Include 
type=&quot;reference&quot; source=&quot;DATA:static.xml&quot; /&gt;<br>
&lt;Include 
type=&quot;reference&quot; source=&quot;DATA:global.xml&quot; /&gt;</span></font><p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">See the section on the 
BinaryAssetBuilder.exe.config for an explanation of the DATA: value.</span><font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Consolas; color: black">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Art 
Files:</span></b></p>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">The Sample MOD includes artwork 
used for the Elven Warrior.&nbsp; These assets can be found in the EU, and HC sub 
folders of the main Art folder.&nbsp; Please note that the use of ART: in an include 
statement will automatically create a sub folder&nbsp; consisting of the first two 
letters in the art file you are including.&nbsp; For example:</span><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; text-autospace: none; margin-left: .5in">
<font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Consolas; color: black">&lt;Include<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; type=&quot;all&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source=&quot;ART:EULorWar_SKN.w3x&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /&gt;</span></font></p>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">This file will be searched for in 
the Art\EU folder.&nbsp; Changing the location that ART: looks in will be covered in 
the next section.&nbsp; Also any art files you work on will need to be located in 
this Art folder not as a sub folder of your MOD directory, unless you 
specifically change the location of the ART: folder.</span><p><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">BinaryAssetBuilder.exe.config</span></b></p>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">This file allows you to modify 
the behavior of the BinaryAssetBuilder program.&nbsp; What this section will cover 
however is only the search paths for the program.&nbsp; In the file you will find the 
section:</span><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; text-autospace: none">
<font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Consolas; color: black">&lt;assetbuilder<br>
