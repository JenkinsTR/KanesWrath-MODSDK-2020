	<h3>Mod Directory Structure</h3>
	<p>When creating a MOD it is recommended you 
follow the data structure laid out in this section of the document, the 
structure can be changed but for the sake of this document we are going to 
assume you follow these guidelines.</p>
In the install directory there is a MODs 
folder.&nbsp; It is recommended you create a folder directly under this folder that 
corresponds with the name of whatever MOD you are creating, then in that folder 
create a data folder. <span class="important">IMPORTANT: The name of your mod can no more than 15 characters long</span> 
You can see an example of this in the SampleMOD folder.&nbsp; 
This is important so the structure of your built MOD is correct and able to be 
read properly by the game after you have built the MOD.&nbsp; After this is done the 
directories created under data are up to the user wants to organize your data.  The directory 
structure for your mod should look similar to the image below.</p>
<img src="images/modDirStruct.png" alt="Mod Directory Structure" />
<h4>Required Files:</h4>
<p>There is only one required file for MOD 
building and that is MOD.xml.&nbsp; This file is the file that should include 
any other files you are adding/editing for your MOD.&nbsp; This is the file that 
the batch file will try to build and directly corresponds to the name of the 
manifest file that will be created by the build process.&nbsp; This manifest is 
also hard coded in the game code so renaming it will cause your MOD not to work. 
For full details on the Mod.xml file, please read the <a href="Mod_XML.htm">Mod.XML Page</a>.
</p>
<p>The only other file that is hard coded as such 
is the MOD.str file.&nbsp; This file is optional and only needed if you are trying to 
add or modify text in the game.</p>
<h4>MOD.str Structure</h4>
An example of how an entry in the MOD.str file is below:
<p class="code">
	NAME:Orca<br />
	"Orca Fighter"<br />
	END<br />
</p>
<p>To replace an existing String entry, simply create a new entry in your Mod.str file with the same 
name as the entry you would like to replace.  You can create new entries simply by adding them to the Str 
file, and reference them from within the .XML files, or Worldbuilder scripts.  If you forget to add a string 
to the STR file, it will show up in the game as MISSING: folowed by the name of the string entry.</p>
